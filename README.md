# intel_image_classification

This repository was set up to go through deploy a binder app as part of the FastAI version 4, lesson 2.

The data was acquired from https://www.kaggle.com/puneet6060/intel-image-classification and the training used the seg_train as the training set and seg_test as the validation set. The seg_pred was kept as the test set. You may use images from the test set or any other source.
